        <p>Elementary</p>
        <h3>In elementary school, we cultivate a love for learning in every child. Our teaching is fast-paced, rigorous, and fun—with plenty of celebratory cheers built into each lesson. We build community around values like respect, hard work, and kindness, shaping the hearts as well as the minds of our students. Our goal is for students to love school from the very start.

          <p>Middle</p>
          <h3>In middle school, our students learn the academic skills they need to succeed in high school, while developing their own identities as citizens of their communities and of the world. They learn to think deeply, to debate passionately, and to engage thoughtfully with new people, places, and ideas.
